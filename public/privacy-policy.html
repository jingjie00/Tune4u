      require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of
      time in which users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing
      legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
      either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible
      (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
      archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
      isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 7. WHAT
